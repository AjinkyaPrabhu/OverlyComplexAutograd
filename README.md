# Useless automatic differentiation
A Symbolic Auto Grad system <br>
Create any function using the classes and use the 'd(variable to differentiate against)' member to get the  Symbolic derivative <br>
## Reasons not to use this
1) Pretty useless since it has limited number of functions and doesn't optimize for redundant expressions <br>
