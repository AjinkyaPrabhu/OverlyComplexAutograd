# OverlyComplexAutograd
An Auto Grad system without graphs<br>
Create any function use the classes and use the 'd(variable to differentiate against)' member to get the  Symbolic derivative <br>
->print the function to view how the funciton is stored<br>
->Derivative can be calculated any number of times<br>
->Pretty useless since it has limited number of functions and doesn't optimize for redundant expressions <br>
