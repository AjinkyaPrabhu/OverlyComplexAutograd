# OverlyComplexAutograd
An Auto Grad system without graphs
Create any function use the classes and use the 'd(variable to differentiate against)' member to get the  Symbolic derivative
->print the function to view how the funciton is stored
->Derivative can be calculated any number of times
->Pretty useless since it has limited number of functoins and doesn't optimize for redundant expressions
